# Welcome to mixed effects modeling in R {-}
The saemix project is an R package [@saemix2017] available in CRAN that implements the Stochastic Approximation of the EM (SAEM) algorithm introduced in [@kuhn]. 
This algorithm is state-of-the-art method for fitting, possibly non linear, models in agronomy, animal breeding or Pharmacokinetics-Pharmacodynamics (PKPD) analysis. 

Thus far, the main area using the package thus far is Pharmacology, especially to understand how drugs, under development, behave in the body or how the body reacts to a drug during clinical trials but we ought to aim at a more general audience of biostatisticians dealing with nonlinear mixed effects modeling.
